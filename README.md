# compileaur
idek if compiling is what it's called but honestly just check the .sh script cuz everything you need to know is in there, if you have any concerns, just don't use it lol this is my first ever "program" or wtv

just do "compileaur (package from aur)" if there's no package with that name, it will just throw a generic error
idek why i made this, i honestly just find it cooler to use (even though making it automatically do makepkg -si kinda defeats the purpose of it lmao)
